# ImageCaption-Suggestion
This Tkinter GUI application blends two images and generates captions using a pre-trained transformer model. It employs OpenCV for image processing and MediaPipe for real-time gesture recognition to adjust blending ratios. Users can upload images, blend them, and receive captions while a camera feed is displayed.
